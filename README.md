# Fraud_Detection-Cap-stone-project

Problem Statement : 
Financial fraud, especially in online transactions, poses a significant threat to businesses and customers worldwide. Detecting fraudulent activities in real-time is challenging due to the massive volume of transactions, class imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent cases, and the constantly evolving tactics of fraudsters. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on historical transaction data, helping financial institutions minimize losses and enhance customer trust.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions based on historical data. The project focuses on handling class imbalance, identifying patterns in transaction behavior, and improving fraud detection accuracy without deployment.

ðŸ“Š Business Insights
Fraudulent transactions show unique patterns in amount, frequency, and location.
Rare events require special handling (imbalanced data).
Continuous monitoring & model updates are crucial to counter evolving fraud tactics.

ðŸ’¡ Value Addition
Reduces financial losses by early fraud detection.
Builds customer trust through secure transactions.
Supports real-time monitoring & investigation decisions.

ðŸ“‚ Project Assets
Source Code â€“ All scripts for data preprocessing, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
Presentation (PPT) â€“ Created as part of the capstone project, summarizing the problem, approach, results, and business impact.
